# RAG-for-PDF-question-answering

In this project, we are developing a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system. The project consists of two main stages:

1. **Notebook Demonstration**: This stage includes a notebook that demonstrates how to build an advanced RAG system using LangChain. The system is designed to answer a userâ€™s questions about a specific knowledge base, working with PDFs.

2. **App Integration**: In the second stage, we integrate the RAG system into an application. This app allows users to load a PDF and ask detailed questions about its content.
